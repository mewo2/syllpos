# Wordlists by part of speech and syllable count

This is a collection of wordlists, taken from the [Brown University Standard
Corpus of Present-Day American English][brown]. Filenames have the form
*postag*-*syllablecount*.txt, where *postag* is the part of speech tag, and
syllable count is the number of syllables in the word.

The part-of-speech tags form part of the corpus, and are described further
[here][postags].

The syllable counts are taken from the pronunciations in the [CMU Pronouncing
Dictionary][cmudict]. Words not included in the CMU dictionary are ignored. In
cases where there is more than one pronunciation listed, the first is used.
